Project for Codecademy: ColmarAcademy, a fictional college

This is the capstone project for the web development course, completing on Jan 9, 2018 and is
used to incorporate only HTML and CSS.

The final submission can be improved by adding another level of responsive design for the middle
area between 500px and about either 1024px or 850px. Given time constraints and lacking specific
direction from the specification, I opted to use the overflow tag. Clearly, this is not the 
optimal solution.
